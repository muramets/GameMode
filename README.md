# MonkeyLearn 🐵

**Gamify your life. Master your potential.**

MonkeyLearn is a personal development platform that turns your life into an RPG. Build your character, join teams, and level up your real-world attributes through daily habits.

## Core Mechanics ⚙️

### 🎭 Personalities
Your digital alter-ego. Create and customize your **Personality** with unique avatars, themes, and icons. This is your vessel for growth, tracking your stats and progress across different domains of your life.

### ⚡️ Powers
Your core attributes. Just like Strength or Intelligence in an RPG, **Powers** (e.g. Focus, Creativity, Vitality) represent your real-life skills and qualities. Watch them level up dynamically as you take action.

### ⚔️ Actions
The engine of change. **Actions** are the actionable habits and routines you commit to. Performing an Action awards XP and directly impacts your targeted Powers.

### 🌌 Dimensions
The realms of your life. **Dimensions** are the broader categories that organize your Powers and Actions, giving you a high-level view of your balanced growth.

### 🏰 Teams & Roles
Don't go it alone. Join **Teams** to adopt specialized **Roles**—curated templates created by the community. Roles give you a pre-built roadmap of Actions and Powers designed to help you master specific skills or lifestyles.

### 📈 History Feed
Your journey, recorded. Every check-in, stat change, and level-up is captured in your History Feed. Analyze your patterns and see how far you've come.
